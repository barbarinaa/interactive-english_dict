# interactive-english_dict
An interactive English Dictionary App. I created this app as a part of "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications" Udemy course. 

With this mini application I gained better understanding of the use of conditionals, functions and control flow as well as retrieveing data from the file.

## installation
This is a console app so just clone the repo and run the app form the terminal. Enjoy!
