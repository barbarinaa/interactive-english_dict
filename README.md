# interactive-english_dictionary
An interactive English Dictionary App. I created this app as a part of "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications" Udemy course. 

App.py fetches data from the JSON file whilst app_v2.py gets data from the MySQL database.

With this mini application(s) I gained better understanding of the use of conditionals, functions and control flow as well as retrieveing data from the .json file.

## installation
This is a console app so just clone the repo and run the app form the terminal. The program will return definition(s) of the queried words, warn you if the word doesn't exist and suggest similar words. Enjoy!
